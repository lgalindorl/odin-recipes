    <p>Kids can help with this Japanese dish. They can help cook the sticky rice and then roll and assemble the pieces with their preferred ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>300g sushi rice</li>
        <li>100ml rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>KIDS the writing in bold is for you. ADULTS the rest is for you. TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS: Pat out some rice. Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.</li>
        <li>Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.</li>
    </ol>
